# Epoch Shell

Epoch Shell is a personal desktop shell built with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) for a Wayland desktop. It provides the bar, popups, notifications, OSDs, launcher, and polkit prompt used by the session.

The project is intentionally pragmatic: it keeps only the pieces used by the current configuration and favors a small, understandable QML codebase over a generalized shell framework.

## Features

- Top bar with workspace indicators, launcher, media indicator, clock, weather, network, Bluetooth, volume, Tailscale, LocalSend, battery, notifications, system tray items, and system menu.
- LocalSend panel for discovering nearby devices and sending them a file, backed by EpochOxide.
- Capture panel in the bar drawer for region, window, and monitor screenshots and OCR text capture,
  with clipboard, save, and pointer switches, backed by EpochOxide.
- Record panel beside it for starting and stopping screen recordings. Its icon stands down while a
  recording runs, replaced by the indicator below, so only one thing on the bar is about recording
  at a time.
- Night mode toggle in the system menu, with a bar indicator while the screen is warmed.
- Nix panel showing which flake inputs can be updated, with a check button, an update action, and
  a rebuild action per host -- all of which open a terminal rather than changing anything silently.
  Its indicator sits with the alerts, so waiting updates show with the drawer shut.
- Recording indicator next to the drawer arrow: a pulsing dot and elapsed time while a recording
  runs, wherever it was started from, and a click to stop it. It shares that row with the Tailscale
  and LocalSend alerts, and several can show at once.
- Custom launcher backed by `epochoxide` for applications, files, clipboard, windows, and calculator results.
- Notification daemon UI with notification history and do-not-disturb support, including the
  screenshot notifications `epochctl capture screenshot` produces, thumbnail and all.
- Battery panel showing the CPU power profile, governor, energy preference, turbo state, which
  daemon is managing them, battery wear and cycle count, and a stay-awake switch.
- Keyboard backlight OSD alongside the volume, media, and screen brightness ones.
- Sound, media, and brightness OSDs.
- Network, Bluetooth, audio, battery, weather, calendar, media, notification, and system popups.
- Built-in polkit authentication agent with password and fingerprint-aware UI.
- Optional external config override file at `~/.config/epochshell/config.toml`.

## Running Locally

Run the repo version directly during development:

```bash
quickshell -p /home/brian/projects/EpochShell/quickshell -vv
```

If the installed system service is already running, stop it first to avoid duplicate notification and polkit registration:

```bash
systemctl --user stop epochshell.service
quickshell -p /home/brian/projects/EpochShell/quickshell -vv
```

When finished:

```bash
Ctrl-C
systemctl --user start epochshell.service
```

To reduce Qt font database noise during development:

```bash
quickshell -p /home/brian/projects/EpochShell/quickshell -vv --log-rules 'qt.text.font.db=false'
```

## Launcher

The launcher is implemented in `quickshell/modules/LauncherOverlay.qml` and uses `quickshell/services/LauncherService.qml` to query EpochOxide over `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/epochoxide.sock`.

Open/toggle is wired through the launcher icon on the bar and the launcher IPC target:

```bash
quickshell ipc call launcher toggle
```

Provider prefixes come from EpochOxide itself: the launcher reads the `providers` response and
routes on the `prefixes` each provider reports (configured under `[query_prefixes]` in the
EpochOxide config), so the shell never hardcodes them. With the EpochOxide defaults that is:

| Prefix | Provider |
|--------|----------|
| `/` | Files |
| `>` | Runner |
| `#` | Clipboard |
| `@` | Windows |
| `=` | Calculator |

Each custom menu in EpochOxide's `menus_dir` is a provider of its own, named after the menu, so it
takes a prefix the same way and is jumped straight into rather than drilled down to. Giving the
keybinds menu `?` is a `"?" = "keybinds"` line in `[query_prefixes]`.

Two prefixes are the shell's own, not the backend's:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `*` | All available providers |
| `;` | Provider picker (lists every live provider with its prefix) |

Typing a math expression can route to the calculator provider automatically when `calc` is available.

The launcher IPC can jump straight to any provider, which is how the compositor binds open a menu:

```bash
qs ipc -p ~/.config/epochshell call launcher openProvider keybinds
qs ipc -p ~/.config/epochshell call launcher openKeybinds   # the same, kept for existing binds
```

Bitwarden/rbw support is intentionally not included in the current config.

### Custom menus

A menu is a TOML file in EpochOxide's `menus_dir` (`~/.config/epochoxide/menus`), and each one
becomes a provider named after the menu — searched by prefix, listed in the picker under its own
name and icon. Entries either run a command on Enter or hand back text to copy, and `command`
replaces the entry list with a generator that produces them live. See EpochOxide's README for the
file format; the shell reads whatever the backend reports.

An `icon` is either a freedesktop icon name resolved through the icon theme (`input-keyboard`) or
a Nerd Font glyph drawn in the theme font (`icon = "󰌌"`), at menu level, entry level, or both —
a menu's icon is the fallback for entries that name none. Anything short and outside the ASCII
range is treated as a glyph, so icon names are never mistaken for one.

Menus are deployed the same way as everything else here — from the dotfiles repo, not by hand.
`users/brian/modules/epochshell/` holds the keybinds menu: `menus/keybinds.sh` reads the running
compositor's binds (niri's `config.kdl`, else `hyprctl binds` cross-referenced against
`hyprland.lua` so a Lua config's binds still get readable names), wrapped in a derivation that
carries its own `jq`/`python3`, and a `home.file` entry writes the `keybinds.toml` that points at
it. The shortcut is one line in the EpochOxide settings:

```nix
programs.epochshell.epochoxide.settings.query_prefixes = {
  "?" = "keybinds";
};
```

Home Manager installs and starts EpochOxide by default when EpochShell is enabled. The backend can be configured through `programs.epochshell.epochoxide`:

```nix
programs.epochshell = {
  enable = true;

  epochoxide = {
    enable = true;
    enableService = true;
    socket = "%t/epochoxide.sock";
    runtimePackages = with pkgs; [ wl-clipboard xclip xdg-utils wmctrl tesseract libqalculate imagemagick librsvg fd ];
    settings = {
      file_roots = [ "~" ];
      persistent_index = true;
      provider_enabled.files = true;
      provider_enabled.clipboard = true;
    };
  };
};
```

Launcher sizing:

- Normal mode: fixed launcher panel size from the QML defaults.
- Files mode (`/`): `60%` screen width by `60%` screen height.
- Clipboard mode (`:`): `60%` screen width by `60%` screen height.
- Preview pane width scales relative to the current panel width.

## Polkit

`quickshell/Polkit.qml` registers a Quickshell polkit agent at:

```text
/org/epochshell/PolkitAgent
```

Only one polkit agent can be active for a session. If local development does not show the prompt, another agent is probably already registered. Check the logs for:

```text
epochshell polkit agent registered
```

Test a prompt with:

```bash
pkexec ls /root
```

The prompt supports password auth and a fingerprint waiting state when `pam_fprintd.so` is present in `/etc/pam.d/polkit-1`. It also checks laptop lid state and falls back to password when the reader is physically unavailable.

## Configuration

Epoch Shell has built-in defaults in `quickshell/theme/Config.qml`. You can override any supported value with:

```text
~/.config/epochshell/config.toml
```

The file is optional. If it does not exist, defaults are used. If it exists, it is treated as a partial override: include only the keys you want to change.

The file is watched by Quickshell, so changes are reloaded at runtime.

Example:

```toml
accent = "#ff00aa"
background = "#0e1013"
fontFamily = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Propo"
fontSizeLarge = 22
barHeight = 44
workspaceStripMaxWidthRatio = 0.35
panelAnimationsEnabled = true
```

The parser supports flat TOML-style key/value lines:

```toml
key = "string"
key = 123
key = 0.45
key = true
```

Section headers are ignored, so grouped files like this are also accepted:

```toml
[theme]
accent = "#4fa6ed"
barHeight = 40
```

Unknown keys are ignored with a warning.

### Color Keys

```toml
accent = "#4fa6ed"
accentLightShade = "#1a4fa6ed"
inactive = "#bfa0a8b7"
active = "#a0a8b7"
activeSelection = "#282c34"
background = "#0e1013"
surface = "#1f2329"
surfaceVariant = "#323641"
surfaceContainer = "#1f2329"
surfaceContainerHigh = "#282c34"
surfaceContainerHighest = "#30363f"
surfaceText = "#a0a8b7"
outline = "#8c9199"
purple = "#bf68d9"
green = "#8ebd6b"
orange = "#cc9057"
blue = "#4fa6ed"
yellow = "#e2b86b"
cyan = "#48b0bd"
red = "#e55561"
bg_blue = "#61afef"
bg_yellow = "#e8c88c"
```

Derived colors such as `accentLightShade`, `inactive`, `active`, and `activeSelection` update automatically from their source colors unless explicitly overridden.

### Font Keys

volumeSliderSize = 40
volumeSliderRadius = 20
volumeSliderMargin = 30
volumeSliderSpacing = 10
```

## Nix Updates

The Home Manager module carries the flake watcher's settings, which it passes to EpochOxide:

```nix
programs.epochshell.nixUpdates = {
  enable = true;
  flake = "~/nixconfig";
  checkIntervalMinutes = 60;
  updateCommand = "nixupdate";          # runs through your login shell, so aliases work
  hosts = [
    { name = "thor"; rebuild = "nixswitch"; }
  ];
};
```

Checking never writes to the flake. `updateCommand` and each host's `rebuild` run in a terminal, in
the flake's directory, through your login shell interactively -- so a shell alias is a valid
command here -- and the terminal stays open when the command finishes so its output survives.

Hosts you do not list are read from the flake's `nixosConfigurations` and fall back to
`rebuildCommand` with `%HOST%` substituted; with no `rebuildCommand` they are shown without a
rebuild action rather than with one that cannot work.

## Dependencies

Epoch Shell expects these tools/services to be available in the session:

- `quickshell`
- `epochoxide` for launcher results, activation, Tailscale state/actions, LocalSend
  discovery/transfers, and screen capture
- `grim`, `slurp`, and `libnotify` for screenshots: EpochOxide takes the shot and announces it with
  `notify-send`, which this shell answers as the session's notification server. The Home Manager
  module installs all three.
- `tesseract` for the capture panel's OCR row; the panel hides it when tesseract is missing.
- `wf-recorder` for the record panel and its bar indicator, dimmed and disabled the same way.
- `nix` and a terminal for the Nix panel's check, update, and rebuild actions.
- `hyprlock` for the lock action
- `wpctl`/PipeWire stack for audio controls
- `networkmanager` stack for network controls
- `bluetoothctl`/BlueZ stack for Bluetooth controls
- `tailscale` for EpochOxide's Tailscale backend
- LocalSend needs no local app: EpochOxide speaks the protocol itself, so the panel finds devices
  whether or not the desktop app is running here
- `pkexec`/polkit for privileged auth prompts
- Optional `pam_fprintd.so` configuration for fingerprint auth

Some modules are compositor-aware. Hyprland and Niri support are represented by compositor services and workspace modules.

## Development Notes

- The active shell root is `quickshell/shell.qml`.
- Theme and sizing defaults live in `quickshell/theme/Config.qml`.
- QML services are registered in `quickshell/services/qmldir`.
- The current codebase intentionally omits older grouped bar, overview, Nix update, and Bitwarden/rbw paths.
- Live installed config may be generated or read-only depending on the system setup; for development, run directly with `quickshell -p` from this repo.
